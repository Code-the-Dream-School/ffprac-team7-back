# StuffFindr

An app that focuses reuniting owners with their belongings. StuffFindr allows users to post items that have been lost or found in different locations, giving other users the opportunity to claim their lost items confidently and securely.

## Back-End Repo for StuffFindr

This will be the API for the front-end [StuffFindr React app](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/ffprac-team7-front). Follow these instructions to setup the local development environment in order to run both the back-end server and the front-end app.

>The back-end server will be running on port 8000. The front-end app will be running on port 3000. You will need to run both the back-end server and the front-end app at the same time to test app.


## Setting up local development environment

1. Create a folder to contain both the front-end and back-end repos 
2. Clone this repository to that folder
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Pull the latest version of the `main` branch (when needed)
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
6. Open http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ with your browser to test.
7. Your back-end server is now running. You can now run the front-end app.

## Technologies Used

This StuffFinder API utilizes **Node.js** as the back-end server environment and **Express.js** as the framework.

MongoDB is used as the database along with the Node.js dependency Mongoose, which is used as an object modeling tool to create the two database schemas that will be used in this application: the User Model and the Item Model.
